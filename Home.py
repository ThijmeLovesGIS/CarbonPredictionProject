st.write("For my final year at university it is required to complete a 5 month internship. I got the oppurtunity to follow this internship at Archipelagos Institute of Marine Conservation in the GIS team. This was perfect since during my study I discovered my interest for GIS and data analysis and using this to solve real-world environmental problems. This perfectly aligns with the oppurtunity I got at Archipelagos.")

st.write("In my time here I worked on a project to estimate how much carbon is stored on the island of Samos in Greece. This work contributes to some of the conservation goals that Archipelagos aims to achieve. Next to that this is a final project for my internship to show how I developed my skills in my time here. But also to show how I adapted my knowledge I gathered during the past three years at university. During my stay here I also needed to work on personal goals setup by the univeristy and myself to further develop myself. That is why I decided to do this project in Python since I had no previous knowledge on using the programming language and it playing a essential part in the GIS sphere. That is why I decided to learn how to adapt my GIS knowledge by use of Python.")
