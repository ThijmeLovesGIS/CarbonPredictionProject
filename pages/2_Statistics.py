         For the statistical analysis of the tree measurments it was decided to first check if the data was normally distributed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. After a Levene's test was ran to see if the variances differ. Based on these outcomes follow up test were performed to compare the groups. These are:
         - If the Shapiro-Wilk test is ***significant*** and the Levene's tes* is ***equal*** a ***T-test*** is used
         - If the Shapiro-Wilk test is ***significant*** and the Levene's test is ***unequal*** a ***Welch's T-test*** is used
         - If the Shapiro-Wilk trest is ***not significant*** a ***Mann-Whitney U test*** is used
         - For the T-test the Cohen's d can be calculated and for the Mann-Whitney test the rank-biserial correlation can be calculated to determine the effect size (How big is the difference)
