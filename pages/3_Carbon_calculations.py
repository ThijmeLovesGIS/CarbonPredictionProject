        The measurements that were taken were the circumference at breast height in meters which were converted earlier to diameter at breast height in centimeters and the height in meters. These two variables are needed to be able to estimate the amount of carbon stored in the trees in kg. For these various formulas were used based on the following research:
        - For most of the formulas except the above ground biomass this website was used: 
            - https://www.ecomatcher.com/how-to-calculate-co2-sequestration/
        - For the above ground biomass this research paper was used. The Chave's formula was mainly made for tropical forests, but can also be used for mediterranean forests:
            - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262197290_Improved_allometric_models_to_estimate_the_aboveground_biomass_of_tropical_trees
        - To be able to get the right data for the above ground biomass the wood density of species needed to be found for this the following database was used:
            - https://www.fs.usda.gov/nrs/pubs/gtr/gtr-nrs200-2023_appendixes/gtr_nrs200-2023_appendix11.pdf
