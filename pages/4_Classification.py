st.write("To be able to predict the amount of Carbon stored on the forests of Samos a forest classification map is needed. This then can be used for area calculation and other calculations. Copernicus provides a classification map called Corine Land Cover which could be used. However, this map will be less precise due to it being more general for the world and is from 2018. No other classification maps/data exists for the island of Samos. So for more recent and a more accurate classification it was decided to make a forest classification map based on Sentinel 2 imagery. Various classification models exist, but it was opted to use the random forest algorithmn. This algorithmn was chosen since it has high dimensionality so can process the high amount of bands and reduce noise bias. It can also capture complex boundaries better which is case for the forests here on Samos.")

            - Formula: (NIR-Red)*(1+L)/NIR+Red+L

        - Tassled Cap Transformation
            - This is a spectral analysis technique which converts spectral data into three components which singnify different properties.
            - Every sattelite has different coefficients which need to be used to apply the transformation correctly. For this project the following research was used to get these coefficients for Sentinel 2:
                - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8836649
            - The three components are as following:
                - To be able to calculate the components firstly the values need to be converted to true reflectance values. This is done by multiplying it by 0.0001
