st.write("To be able to predict the amount of Carbon stored on the forests of Samos a forest classification map is needed. This can then be used for area calculation and other calculations. Copernicus provides a classification map called Corine Land Cover which could have been used. However, this map would have been less precise, as it  shows more general world coverage and originates  from 2018. No other classification maps/data exists for the island of Samos, so  for a more recent and a more accurate classification it was decided to make a new forest classification map based on Sentinel 2 imagery. Although various classification models do exist,a random forest algorithm was chosen instead, because it has high dimensionality and can thus  process the high amount of bands while  reducing noise bias. It can also capture complex boundaries better, which is particularly useful  for the forests on Samos.")

        - Tasseled Cap Transformation
            - This is a spectral analysis technique which converts spectral data into three components which signify differen properties.
            - Every satellite has different coefficients which need to be used to apply the transformation correctly. For this project the following research was used to get the coefficients for Sentinel 2:
                - https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8836649
            - The three components are as following:
                - To calculate the components, the values first need to be converted to true reflectance values. This was done by multiplying it by 0.0001
