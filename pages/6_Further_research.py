st.write("Based on these carbon results/forest classification map various other projects could sprout out of this. One of the most important ones is looking how much carbon/forest is lost on the island after a forest fire. This is important to see the impact that forest fires have on the biodiveristy of mediterranean forest and in this way really being able to see the devastation. This could also be used to look back in time to see how forests recovered from these fires or how much forest is lost in the years before. Another important project could be looking into climate policy and carbon offset feasibility together with REDD+. Lastly a project could be done on efficient restoration and management planning. So to protect certain parts of the forest on the island and restoring other parts.")

st.write("Due to time limitations and lack of knowledge of Python in the beginning there are some areas where this project could be improved on. First of all some of the code could have been written more efficiently, but overall it achieves it's goal. Secondly more field measurements could have been done over various part of the island for a more clear view on the amount carbon stored in the forests on Samos. This could also have lead to a better view of the forests and result in more precise taining data. It could also give the possibility to maybe add mixed forests which are present on some small parts of the island. Thirdly during the field measurements for every tree the species could have been identified instead of only using the most common species. This could give a more precise wood density value. Lastly more time could have been spent in fine tuning the random forest model by changing some parameters and adding/improving training samples. The classification is already quite accurate but some small areas could still be improved.")
