st.write("Based on the carbon results and forest classification map, various other projects could succeed this project. One critical theme for further research concerns is how much forest and thus carbon is lost on the island after a forest fire. This is important, as it shows how forest fires affect the (local) environment, especially as climate change may make the island more vulnerable to such fires. . Furthermore, such research could also be used to look back into the past  and see  whether forests on the island recovered, or instead how much forest has been lost from such fires. Another important potential project could look into climate policy and carbon offset feasibility together with REDD+.  A final further research opportunity could be done on efficient restoration and management planning, to get a better understanding of which parts of the forest on the island should receive extra protection and which areas should be restored ")

st.write("Due to temporal limitations and lack of knowledge of Python, there were several  in the areas where this project could be improved on, especially at the start. Firstly,some of the code could have been written more efficiently, although it did achieve its goal overall. Secondly, more field measurements could have been done over various parts of the island to get a  better estimate of the amount of carbon stored in the forests on Samos. This could also have led to a coverage of the  forests and thus also result in more precise training data. It could also have given the opportunity to maybe incorporate mixed forests, which are indeed present on some small parts of the island. Thirdly, during the field measurements , every tree species  could have been identified, rather than only using the most common species. This would have given a more precise wood density value. Lastly, more time could have been spent on fine tuning the random forest model by changing some parameters and adding/improving training samples. Although the  classification is quite accurate, some small areas could still have been improved.")
